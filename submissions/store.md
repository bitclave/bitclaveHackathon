**Project Description**
<!--(1-2 sentences about this project. Motivations, goals, functionality -- you name it.)-->
This project solves the problem of obtaining low-quality advertising for users. And allows users to get paid for personal data.

The application collects information about the interests of users (their preferences in goods and services).
Data is saved on the Block Chain service.
Stores representing goods and services filter users depending kinds of goods and services, which they produce. When stores will have discounts (or interesting offers) they can inform only filtered users, which live not far from this store locations, and only those users, who were filtered by goods groups.
Users receive advertising notifications from stores per money of their given data for them.
