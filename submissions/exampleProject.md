# A ranking system for the Bitclave Hackathon

## Project Description
This is a ranking system for the BASE ecosystem. All the information used by the system are retrieved and stored in BASE so the privacy of the data is still considered. However, the algorithm is open source so anyone can see it and confirm its validity and fairness. 
The main purpose of the system is to give confidence to both parties, retailers and consumers, about a possible transcation. Retailers pay to advertise, so they would like to be confident that their ad has a high likelihood of turning into a purchase. On the other hand, consumers would like to buy goods only from reputable retailers.
Additionally, the system can also identify consumers who are exploiting the ecosystem with the intention to make money, without actually intenting to buy anything. These consuerms will receive a very low score very fast, which will alert a potential advertiser. On the other hand, it motivates both parties to store their data into the system, which results in a higher rank, due to the fact that advertisements can be tightly targeted on their needs.
