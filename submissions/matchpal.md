**Project Description**
<!--(1-2 sentences about this project. Motivations, goals, functionality -- you name it.)-->
The goal of this project is to allow users to retrieve and upload prices of items so that people nearby can make the informed purchase decision. Utilizing blockchain, users will upload prices, and when another user purchases the item thanks to the information provided by an uploader, part of their spending will go to the uploader. This will incentivize people to not only upload data, but to buy via our method.
